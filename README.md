# Work Day Scheduler

This simple calendar application allows the user to save events for each hour of the day.
The current date is always on top with multiple hourly timeblocks of that day displayed.

If a timeblock is gray, then the time for that block has already passed.
If red then the timeblock is current.
If green, the timeblock has yet to come.

You are able to create an event in a time block and save it using the save button. 
By doing so, it will persist as it is saved to local storage

(Note: I accidently uploaded an old html at one point by accident)
